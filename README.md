I see the discussion section of the competition could be really helpful to understand the problem. Like following threads seems interesting to start with: 
- https://www.kaggle.com/c/m5-forecasting-uncertainty/discussion/133613. Please go through the whole thread including discussion
- https://www.kaggle.com/c/m5-forecasting-uncertainty/discussion/133692
- Suggested in one of the comments. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207019301153
